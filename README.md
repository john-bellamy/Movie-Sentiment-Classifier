# Movie-Sentiment-Classifier
## A movie review sentiment classifier based on the IMDB ratings dataset from Stanford.
## See an example of the app here: http://www.jlbdatasci.com/jobs/review/
Stochastic Gradient Descent is a great option for building data science web apps, where new data is constantly coming in (IOT is a use-case too) and for processing large amounts of data on a single machine.

# Requirements
Assuming you have sklearn installed:
1) Install Pyprind (conda/pip install pyprind)

# Install
1) After cloning/uzipping file, unzip DATA\ratings_shuffled.zip into DATA\

# Use
From Command line: 
1) Navigate to project folder that contains sgd_movie_classifier
2) Run command: python sgd_movie_classifier.py

Otherwise, load in your favorite IDE.	

Once the model is built, you can use the model in your own app. See link above to see this model in action.
